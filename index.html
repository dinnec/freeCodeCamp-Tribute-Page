					<div class="col-md-6"><p class="review">&#8220;It has tech lust, which so many of us swim in, for a starting point. And it has consistently funny writing. It's the best, most wide-appeal show that HBO has had in ages.&#8221;</p>

					<div class="col-md-6"><p class="review">&#8220;Silicon Valley both reflects and distorts the hermetically sealed cult of tech... [It] may truly be the satire of our times.&#8221;</p>
